When user clicks on any of the private route, he or she should be directed to the login page.
When user logins by entering the correct credentials he should be re-directed to the page where he actually wanted to go and not on the home page or any other page.
After successful login if user clicks the back button the login page should not come up. Hence remove the login page from History.
